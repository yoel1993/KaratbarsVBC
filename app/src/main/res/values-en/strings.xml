    <string name="large_text_cripto_3">\nProblem\n</string>
    <string name="large_text_cripto_4">In other times, gold was a means of direct payment, especially in the form of gold coins. However, gold has been continuously replaced by bank notes, which currently do not have, or only have a marginal percentage, the support of state gold. Therefore, the value of the bills issued by the different countries is based on the confidence that the respective country can pay their bills. Only this is less secure than in other times. Especially in less developed countries, the reliability of legal tender moves towards zero.\n</string>
    <string name="large_text_cripto_5">Solution</string>
    <string name="large_text_cripto_6">\nKaratGold Coin responds perfectly to global needs because it is based on gold.

    <string name="large_text_faqs_1">\n\nWho is Karatbars International?</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_2">www.karatbars.com is the homepage of the Karatbars group. This company is designed to sell precious metals, especially small gold ingots, embedded in design cards that include certifications. Thanks to our independent activity of banks, we can offer a selection of suitable products without the influence of external social interests.\n\nKaratbars International is a commercial company present on the Internet and its products can be sent all over the world, to a list of increasingly larger and constantly expanding countries.\n</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_3">\nIs Karatbars legal?</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_4">Yes, Karatbars is a company legally registered in Germany and complies with the current legislation of the more than 120 countries in which it has opened its operations.\n</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_5">\nWhat product does Karatbars International offer?</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_6">The Karatbars group offers the most extraordinary range of products on the market. Karatbars gold bars have the highest quality standards.\n\nAtasay \"(in Turkey) is the producer and supplier of our one-gram gold bars of the\" ATAKULCHE \"brand. This company has been included in the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), with the seal \"Good Delivery\" since 07/05/2010, which guarantees the stability of production and supplies. In this refinery, we have our own production chain, so we can be there and develop our own production, regardless of the daily operations of the refinery.\n\nIn addition, Karatbars and more recently, has partnered with the best gold producer in Germany, \"Degussa\" and \"Nadir Metal\", which together with Atasay, are the best producers in Turkey.\n\nIn our featured products, we can recommend country cards, with our 1 gram gold. They are special cards, and with glorious colors showing the respective national flags. These Karatbars gold ingots are characterized by their distinction and finishing of the highest quality.\n\nYou also have the opportunity to purchase collectible and limited edition gold cards. Our goal is to offer different editions with a variety of interesting topics. Since we often need a license for these cards, the price differs a bit from the normal gold card.\n\nKaratbars International, only offers ingots of pure gold, of 999.9, of the highest quality in production and with the best certifications and supports.\n</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_7">\nIs it really gold?</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_8">Yes, the ingots of 1 gram, 2.5 grams and 5 grams are 24 carat gold with a purity of 999% of refineries certified by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA).\n</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_9">\nWhy are ingots so small?</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_10">Because the Karatbars mission is to offer people of all types and conditions the possibility of accessing savings with gold. People with little income can already save with gold, something that was not possible before. And people with high incomes have the ability to get their gold in a comfortable, discreet, and easy to store and transport.\n</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_11">\nCan I get advice about my purchase decision?</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_12">Our team is worldwide throughout the day. We also provide information and video presentations so you can learn in detail why you should invest in gold. The decision of when and how much to invest in gold, however, is up to you. To help you make a consensual decision and with what we offer, you can, for free, subscribe to our newsletter to get updates and news about current market events.\n</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_13">\nAre the karatbars ingots expensive?</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_14">Not at all, all gold distribution companies add a Premium to the market price that is their profit margin. The price of Karatbars ingots is precisely that of the daily market plus the Premium, which is why it changes. In addition, there is an annual discount bonus of 3%. There may be companies that put the price of the gram somewhat cheaper, although many others make it even more expensive. The advantage is that Karatbars distributes part of that Premium with its affiliates through commissions. And in that way, the real price of each gram of gold may end up being much lower than the market price itself, even if it covers it completely and goes free.\n</string>
    <string name="large_text_faqs_15">\nHow can I buy karatbars ingots?</string>

    <string name="large_text_bienvenidos_1">\n\nPresentation of Karatbars International GbmH</string>
    <string name="large_text_bienvenidos_2">Karatbars International emerged in 2011 to the idea of Mr. Harald Seiz who is CEO and founder of the company. \n\nThis company is currently active in more than 120 countries. Its headquarters are located in Stuttgart, Germany. Its goal is to produce nothing more and nothing less than gold bars 999.9 thousandths of purity of 24k in small quantities of 1 gram, 2.5 and 5 grams making this product affordable for any pocket.\n\nThis is the highest quality gold available and comes sealed in a high quality plastic the size of a credit card and is fully accredited by the LBMA, for its acronym, the Precious Metals Market Association of London.  \n\nNow let me make it clear, we are not asking anyone to buy something, we are simply exchanging a part of our paper money for real money, which is gold. \n \nSo let me ask you a question here: If you could exchange a part of your paper currency for physical gold 999.9 thousandths of purity of 24k produced by the refinery accredited by the LBMA and earn a juicy commission for only referring others, it would ? \n \nMost likely yes. I think that only a few times in life there is a really fantastic opportunity on our way, and that some people let go, and then they complain saying, oh, but he got lucky, she got lucky, or they have good contacts, education adequate, the circle of appropriate friendships and blah blah blah blah ... and never assume their responsibility and take advantage of these opportunities.  \n\nWell, I think luck is defined as when the opportunity coincides with the preparation, and I think this is one of those occasions when the opportunity knocks on your door. But the question is: Are you prepared to take advantage of it? \n\nI hope so for your good.\n\n\n</string>
